# Exploring Bril: A Compiler Homework Experience
## Introduction
For this assignment, I explored the Bril intermediate representation and wrote a new benchmark along with a tool to analyze and transform Bril programs. The homework was divided into two main parts:

- **Part 1**: Creating and Running a New Benchmark
- **Part 2**: Implementing a Bril Program Analyzer/Transformer

Iâ€™ll walk through the details of my implementation, challenges faced, and the testing process.
